# DDE_Toolbox: 

1. This repository contains the code used to produce the results in the paper: Ahsan, Dankowicz, Li and Sieber, “Methods
of Continuation and their Implementation in the COCO Software Platform with application
to delay differential equations”, Nonlinear Dynamics, 2022

2. To run the demo files, you need to install the latest version of the software package "COCO" from https://sourceforge.net/projects/cocotools/

3. Then add the folder "Toolbox_DDE" to the Matlab path directory. 

Disclaimer: The toolboxes posted here are written in the spirit of the toolboxes in Part II of [1], and do not constitute production-ready toolbox as those released with COCO (which also include adaptive meshing).
